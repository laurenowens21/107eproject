## Project description
We are aiming to implement a driving game, using the Pi as a steering wheel. Drawing inspiration from the game Pole Position, we will have a rotary encoder for steering wheel functionality and potentiometers for brake and gas functionality. Equipped to a monitor via HDMI, we will build a graphics library to display the game and the features, such as score, laps, speed, and time. The end goal is to have a functioning game.
Stretch goals include the brake/gas functionality with the potentiometer, and a potential gear shift as well as sound. Our fallback position is connecting the Pi to the monitor to act as a steering wheel (no speed change functionality).

## Hardware, budget
All parts were ordered through Professor Gregg. We posted on the Ed forum for this with parts, links, and quantity.
These parts amounted to $46, which we agreed to split the difference of the budger overflow.
These parts included a linear potentiometer, three potentiometers, and three analog converters. We will be 3D printing other parts with the 3D printer in lab64.

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Lauren: Car Graphics, Road Graphics, Rotary Encoder(*)
Jael: Scenery Graphics, Potentiometers/Converters (*)
*Once parts arrive, we plan on working to implement these together, but will allocate accordingly.

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
-Graphics Done
-3D Printing
-Familiarity with Data Sheets for Sensors
-Beginning to Implement/Debugging Sensors

## Resources needed, issues
-We will need to access example code for coding the potentiometers as well as driver files needed for the communication protocol. This is what we are primarily concerned about: how the sensors will communicate with the Pi. We are also concerned with the fast update of the graphics necessary to depict a game. To help us succeed, we would appreciate help with the optimized graphics and sensors.
